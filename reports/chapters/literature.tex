\cite{mujumdar2019diabetes} aims to create a system using machine learning algorithm and deep learning techniques to provide accurate results and reduce human efforts. The diabetes dataset contains 800 instances with 10 attributes. This study implemented various machine learning algorithms include Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Extra Tree Classifier, Ada Boost algorithm, Perceptron, Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithm, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes,Bagging algorithm, Gradient Boost Classifier. The study incorporates the concept of pipelining and compares the diabetes dataset with the Pima dataset. Performance analysis includes metrics like classification accuracy, confusion matrix, f1-score, precision, and recall. The findings reveal that Logistic Regression achieves the highest accuracy of 96\%, indicating an improvement in accuracy for the diabetes dataset compared to the Pima diabetes dataset. The study concludes that implementing a pipeline model enhances the accuracy of the classification performance, with the Ada Booster classifier identified as the best model, achieving an accuracy of 98.8\%.

\cite{soni2020diabetes} aims to design and implement Diabetes prediction using machine learning methods and performance analysis of that methods for early prediction and to cure diabetes and save humans life. The diabetes dataset is gathered from  UCI repository which is named as Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. The dataset have many attributes of 768 patients. The proposed methodology involves the utilization of various classification and ensemble learning methods, including SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, Rndom Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting classifiers are used. The findings indicate a 77\% accuracy achieved through an 80:20 split. The study concludes that Random Forest classifier exhibits highest accuracy when compared to other machine learning methods.

\cite{swapna2018diabetes} aims to develop a methodology for classification of diabetic and normal Heart rate variability (HRV) signals using advanced deep learning architectures, specifically employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and combinations. The extracted features are then passed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for accurate classification. The study demonstrates performance improvements in CNN and CNN-LSTM architectures compared to earlier work, achieving a high accuracy of 95.7\%.
