Diabetes is a fast growing disease among the people even in youngsters nowadays. It is necessary to understand how it develops in our body. Firstly, we need to understand how a body works without diabetes. Sugar comes from the food that we eat, specially carbohydrates. When we eat this food, the body breaks them down to Sugars or Glucose. This glucose moves around the body in the bloodstream. This glucose was needed by body parts like brain, pancreas to function. The remainder of glucose is taken to the cells of our body and liver which is stored as energy for later use. In order to use glucose for our body, insulin is required which is a hormone generated by pancreas. Insulin is a key to a closed door which helps glucose moves from blood stream. If pancreas is not able to produce enough insulin or if our body cannot use insulin it produces then glucose levels increases in bloodstream which leads to diabetes.

According to World Health Organization, diabetes is major cause of death worldwide. Around 422 million people worldwide have diabetes. Indeed, it caused deaths of 2 million people in 2019.

\section*{Types of Diabetes}
\textbf{Type 1} diabetes appear most often during childhood and characterized by the partial functioning of pancreas. The cells fail to produce sufficient amounts of Insulin. Initially, we do not see any symptoms as the pancreas remains partially functional. There is no proven study and known methods for prevention.

\textbf{Type 2} diabetes affects how the body uses sugars for energy. The cells produce low quantity of insulin or the body stops using insulin which can lead to high levels of sugar in bloodstream. High levels of glucose in the bloodstream and urine referred as Diabetes Mellitus. It is most common type of diabetes found in many people. It is caused by genetic factors and the lifestyle. It affects older adults and more obese or overweight people.

Early prediction of the disease can be controlled and save the life. To accomplish this, this work explores prediction of diabetes by taking various attributes related to diabetes disease. For this purpose, we use the Diabetes Dataset \cite{dataset} which has 2000 instances with 9 attributes - `Pregnancies`, `Glucose`, `BloodPressure`, `SkinThickness`, `Insulin`, `BMI`, `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`, `Age`, `Outcome` for creating classification models using logistic regression and support vector machine algorithms.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:into_back}
This study is undertaken to address the crucial need for accurate and reliable methods in predicting diabetes using logistic regression and support vector machine algorithms on patient data. The motivation behind this study stems from the growing significance of leveraging machine learning algorithms to assist medical professionals in diagnosing and managing diabetes. Predictive models based on patient data offer the potential to identify individuals at risk or in the early stages of diabetes, enabling proactive and personalized healthcare strategies. Algorithms - logistic regression and support vector machine are chosen due to their widespread use in medical data analysis and their capability to handle classification tasks. The study outcomes have practical implications for healthcare practitioners and researchers, offering insights into algorithm selection for accurate and interpret diabetes prediction.

\section{Research question}
\label{sec:intro_prob_art, linewidth:80}
This section provides a detailed exploration of the research problem. The main question is about understanding how accurate logistic regression and support vector machine are in predicting diabetes from patient's data. The focus is on figuring out what factors cause differences in accuracy, especially looking at the impact of hyper parameters.

\section{Aims and objectives}
\label{sec:intro_aims_obj}

The primary aim of this study is to assess and compare the predictive accuracy of logistic regression and support vector machine algorithms based on diabetic patient's data to decide if a patient is diabetic or not. This study aims to provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of these supervised machine learning approaches, contributing to the enhancement of diabetes prediction methodologies.

\textbf{Objectives:} 
The main objectives of this study is to do data processing, implement logistic regression and support vector machine models, hyper parameter tuning to achieve highest possible predictive accuracy. At the end, we will evaluate the performance of both classification models based on accuracy and the best model is decided.

The study follows a systematic approach encompassing model implementation, data preprocessing, splitting of data, hyper parameter tuning and performance analysis. Thorough exploration of various meta parameter search strategies contribute to achieving the aims. I will make sure to provide a clear documentation to make sure results are reliable and can be easily reproducible.

\subsection{Dataset Description}
\label{sec:intro_some_sub1}
This Diabetes Dataset \cite{dataset} has 2000 instances with 9 attributes - `Pregnancies`, `Glucose`, `BloodPressure`, `SkinThickness`, `Insulin`, `BMI`, `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`, `Age`, `Outcome`. The `Outcome` attribute indicates positive or negative for diabetes. 

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
\label{sec:intro_some_sub2}
Data preprocessing is most important process. Mostly healthcare related data contains missing values that causes effectiveness of data. This process is essential for accurate result and successful predication using machine learning techniques.

\subsubsection{Missing values removal}
\label{sec:intro_some_subsub1}
This process is meant to identify instances with zero value and eliminate all such instances. Through eliminating irrelevant instances we make feature subset and this process is called feature subset selection which reduces the dimensionality of data.

\subsubsection{Splitting of data}
\label{sec:intro_some_subsub2}
After cleaning the data, the data is normalized in training and testing the models. After split, we train algorithm with training dataset and keep testing dataset aside. This testing dataset is used to test the trained model.

\subsection{Model Implementation}
\label{sec:intro_some_sub3}
After data is ready, we apply machine learning techniques. Implement logistic regression and support vector machine models to predict diabetes on the dataset.

\subsection{Hyper Parameter Tuning and Performance Analysis}
\label{sec:intro_some_sub4}
To determine the best performance model, we should consider the factors like hyper parameters, meta parameter search strategies for logistic regression and support vector machine to achieve more predictive accuracy.
